This exercise took longer expected (as pretty much every exercise usually does).  Perhaps it's time to adjust my expectations.  When the expectation zeitgeist is to systematically underestimate the amount of time things ought to take, though, it's really outside of my control.  I mean, what am I supposed to do?  I can't singlehandedly rewire society to hold back on their optimistic expectations, because that would be shouldering way too much of the burden of society.  There's also the question of whether there's value to underestimating the amount of time something ought to take, because it's akin to dangling a carrot in front of an unsuspecting rabbit/horse (rabbit horse?). 

Anyway, this post was not supposed to be about expectations, free form writing just kind of lead me here.  That's part of the beauty of writing though, and it's why I have the desire to start writing more in general.  To be continued...
