## About

Greetings!  Welcome to my personal website.  

I'm a programmer / statistician living and working in Toronto, Canada.  I love learning, creating, and pursuing innovative ideas.  One outlet for me has always been music, which I've been composing since I was about 13 years old.  When I'm not working or creating, I enjoy playing sports, exploring the great outdoors, playing board games, video games, or mind games with friends, learning new things (cooking, music theory, programming, science), and in general just trying to make the most out of life.

With this site, I'm hoping to write more regularly about topics that I'm interested in, as well as share some of the creations I'll be dreaming up with a wider audience.  If you ever feel like collaborating on anything, please get in touch.  I'm a friendly soul, I swear.
