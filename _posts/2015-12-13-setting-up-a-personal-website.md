This blog post is about setting up a personal website, so let's roll up our sleeves and get cracking.  Don't have any sleeves?  Roll up your pant legs.  Not wearing any pants?  I like your style.  

The goal here is to point readers who are thinking about setting up a personal website in the right direction.  What do you want out of your personal website?  In my case, I wanted a versatile website that I could use for a few different purposes.  Specifically, I wanted a website that could serve (no pun intended) as a professional landing page, a personal blog, and to host music that I've composed over the years.  Wordpress runs approximately 25% of the internet as of Dec 2015, so initially I was going to go with Wordpress since the large adoption rate must mean it's easy to use.  However, I had a Wordpress blog maybe 5 years ago but it was a little clunky, and I wanted to try out some new tech.  So I got in touch with a friend of mine who has done a lot of web development over the years, and he suggested I give Jekyll a shot.  

Jekyll is a static site generator that is blog-aware and creates mobile/tablet/web-friendly websites.  In my opinion, if you're going to use Jekyll, you probably need a bit of a programming background or you need to be willing to get frustrated along the way, which might undermine the fun of creating a website.  To start, I needed a GitHub account.  I already had one through some [prior programming work](https://github.com/jeffbruce/).  For those who don't know, GitHub is a website that allows you to have code repositories online, so you can collaborate with other people on a codebase, keep version histories of your code so you can revert to previous versions if you ever make a mistake, and access your code from anywhere you have an internet connection.  GitHub allows you to host one personal website for *free* on GitHub Pages at the address `yourname.github.io`, which was definitely a plus for me.  

Once you have a GitHub account, the next step is to find a Jekyll theme that you like.  Basically, all I did was search free Jekyll themes, and, through a brutal process of trial and error, I finally settled on a theme.  Honestly, I had to try about 5-10 themes before I settled on one that I liked.  The instructions were incomplete or incorrect for a few of the free Jekyll themes which was quite frustrating.  The process was quite cumbersome overall, and the workflow of trying out different themes is far easier with Wordpress.  Here is the process of trying out a theme on Jekyll in more detail:

1. Leaf through Jekyll themes [here](http://jekyllthemes.org/) to find a few candidates that you like
2. Fork the repository for that Jekyll theme (essentially make a copy for yourself)
3. Follow the instructions for that Jekyll theme, but mainly just modify the one file (_config.yml) to personalize it for yourself
4. It's possible to do this all through GitHub online, but I wanted to set up a way of developing and testing locally, which involves using git from the command line and setting up Jekyll on your local machine (can be a bit of an ordeal for a Windows machine, which is what I was usingâ€”again, here is where it is massively advantageous to have some sort of programming background)
5. Add a custom domain by ordering one from a site such as GoDaddy, link this domain to `https://github.com/yourname/yourname.github.io`, then add a CNAME file to your GitHub repository at `https://github.com/yourname/yourname.github.io`
6. Unfortunately, I learned after going through this that the Jekyll theme that I chose was trying to force https connections, and GitHub Pages does not support https, so I had to resort to using something called [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) which [allows you to use https for GitHub Pages sites with custom domains](https://sheharyar.me/blog/free-ssl-for-github-pages-with-custom-domains/)

I have left Joomla, Drupal, and buying themes such as those sold on [themeforest.net](http://themeforest.net/) out of the discussion on what platform you should build your website with.  My understanding is that Drupal is overkill for a basic personal website, Joomla is somewhere in the middle in terms of complexity, and I didn't want to spend much money so I did not entertain the idea of buying a theme from themeforest.  In summary, here are the advantages/disadvantages of Jekyll vs. Wordpress that I can see:

Advantages:

- web/mobile/tablet-friendly
- produces a very fast website so users enjoy browsing it
- very secure since Jekyll builds a static website with no database or server-side junk that can be exploited
- if you are a programmer, Jekyll is a good learning experience
- can build a website for free by hosting it on GitHub pages
- can host your content as basic markdown files (essentially text files) so that transitioning to another platform in the future is easier
- can add Ruby gems to extend the functionality of your site (similar to Wordpress plugins)

Disadvantages:

- much greater learning curve than Wordpress and will probably take much longer to launch your website
- Wordpress plugins are probably easier to use to add functionality to your website
- experimenting with different themes is much easier with Wordpress

My overall thoughts are that this whole exercise was more complicated than expected, but it was also rewarding to learn a bit about Jekyll.  Hope this helped someone out there!  Signing off for now.  Godspeed.
