## About

Greetings!  Welcome to my personal website.  If you don't know much about me, this page is for you.  For anyone else, stay awhile; Jeeves is somewhere around here serving hors d'oeuvres, and there's some punch by the door.

I'm a programmer / statistician living and working in Toronto, Canada.  I love learning and creating and am regularly overwhelmed with ideas.  One outlet for me has always been music, which I've been composing since I was about 13 years old.  When I'm not working or creating, I enjoy playing sports (primarily backgammon), vigorously inhaling the great outdoors, exploring (Ferdinand Magellan was my great great great grandfather's brother's great great great great great grandfather's aunt's great great great great great great grandfatherâ€”but not actually), playing board games, video games, or mind games with friends, learning new stuff (cooking, music theory, programming, science), and in general just trying to make the most out of life.

With this site, I'm hoping to write more regularly about topics that I'm interested in, as well as share some of the creations I'll be dreaming up with a wider audience.  If you ever feel like collaborating on anything, please get in touch.  I'm a friendly soul, I swear.
